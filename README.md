# Machine Learning for Earth and Environmental Sciences (UMich Climate 405, Fall 2024)
%Lecture materials for University of Michigan CLIMATE405 Machine Learning for Earth and Environmental Sciences (Fall 2024)

## Basic Description
This course aims to introduce students (primarily of Earth and Enviromental Sciences background) to data-driven methods, ranging in complexity from autoregression to machine learning models. The course covers the basic theory behind machine learning and provides hands-on experience in building machine learning models. Students will learn to apply these models for both prediction and hypothesis formulation purposes. The methods will be taught through example applications in environmental sciences, with a specific focus on climate and hydrologic applications. Examples include short-term forecasts of temperature and precipitation, streamflow forecasting in selected hydrologic basins, understanding the relative contributions of temperature and precipitation in snowmelt trends, regional clustering of precipitation patterns and trends, and climatic teleconnections in regulating regional precipitation patterns.
